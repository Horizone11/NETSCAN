Development Master Plan: Network Insecurity Demo Tool
Project: Windows-Native Network Visibility Prototype (Python Edition)
Status: Implementation Ready
Developer: Work Experience Placement
1. Project Overview & Objective
The goal is to produce a "Sales Demonstrator" tool that visualizes passive network traffic. This tool will be used by the Sales Engineering team to show non-technical clients the volume of metadata (DNS, IP destinations, device info) their devices broadcast even when using encrypted services (HTTPS).
Core Mission
"Translate raw network packets into high-impact visual security warnings."
2. Technical Stack Selection
To ensure a working prototype within the 7-day window, the following "High-Speed" stack has been selected:
Primary Language: Python 3.11+ (Chosen for rapid prototyping and extensive networking libraries).
Packet Processing: Scapy (Used for packet sniffing, dissection, and filtering).
System Driver: Npcap (Required for Windows promiscuous mode packet capture).
UI Framework: CustomTkinter or PyQt6 (Chosen for a modern, "Cyber-Security" dark-mode aesthetic).
Packaging: PyInstaller (To bundle the script into a standalone .exe for sales reps).
3. 7-Day Execution Roadmap
Phase 1: Environment & Feasibility (Days 1-2)
Setup: Install Python, VS Code, and Npcap (WinPcap-compatible mode).
Hardware Validation: Write a script to list available network interfaces and verify the Wi-Fi card supports promiscuous mode.
Permission Check: Ensure the Python environment can be elevated to "Administrator" to allow raw socket access.
Phase 2: The "Brain" (Packet Logic) (Days 3-4)
The Sniffer: Implement a background thread using Scapy’s sniff() function.
Protocol Filtering (BPF):
Filter udp port 53 for DNS (Website names).
Filter port 1900 or 5353 for mDNS/SSDP (Local device discovery).
Dissection: Create a function to extract the qname (query name) from DNS packets and translate IP addresses into readable hostnames.
Phase 3: The "Sales" Interface (Days 5-6)
UI Architecture: Build a dashboard with three main views:
Live Feed: Real-time list of detected website requests.
Device Inventory: A list of other devices "discovered" on the network.
Risk Meter: A visual gauge that moves as "Unsecured" (plain-text) packets are detected.
Translation Logic: Create a dictionary to map technical codes to human language (e.g., Port 53 -> Privacy Leak: Website Identity Exposed).
Phase 4: Finalization & Deliverables (Day 7)
Testing: Connect a mobile phone to the laptop’s hotspot and verify the app correctly "sees" the phone's traffic.
Report Generation: Write the 1-2 page Feasibility Report detailing the success of the Python/Windows approach.
Presentation Prep: Prepare a 5-minute demo script focusing on the "Impact" narrative.
4. Key Functional Requirements
Feature
Technical Implementation
Sales Narrative
DNS Sniffing
Capture UDP 53; Decode pkt[DNSQR].qname
"Your phone tells the whole room you are visiting bankofamerica.com."
SSDP Discovery
Capture UDP 1900; Parse headers for device names
"I can see there is a Samsung Smart TV in the room next door."
Host Mapping
Store unique Destination IPs in a list
"I can see your phone is constantly talking to servers in Ireland and the US."
Unsecured Alert
Detect Port 80 (HTTP) traffic
"You are currently browsing an unencrypted site. Your data is visible."

5. Technical Constraints & Mitigation
HTTPS Encryption: We cannot see content (passwords/emails). Mitigation: Focus the demo on metadata (where you are going, not what you are doing), which is still highly impactful.
Admin Rights: The .exe must run as Admin. Mitigation: Use a Manifest file in PyInstaller to automatically request "Run as Administrator."
Public Wi-Fi Limits: Some networks block peer-to-peer traffic. Mitigation: Use the laptop as a Mobile Hotspot for the demo to ensure 100% visibility of the connected client.
6. Deliverables Checklist
[ ] Prototype: Standalone Windows .exe file.
[ ] Source Code: GitHub repository with a clean README.md.
[ ] Feasibility Report: 2-page document (Platform choice, Captured data, Encryption limits).
[ ] Presentation: Live demo + 3-slide pitch deck.
